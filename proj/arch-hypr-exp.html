                        I am more than happy to have gone through the

                        <a href="https://archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> 
                        (a.k.a Arch) is a lightweight operating 
                        system (OS) for people who want near-full control 
                        over their computer. It is a 
                        <a href="https://distrowatch.com/" target="_blank">Linux distribution</a> 
                        (a.k.a distro) that let's you do a lot of cool sh*t. 
                        Unlike most systems that come with everything right 
                        out of the box, Arch starts almost empty and let's 
                        you choose what you want to put in it. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Simply put: You have total freedom and you decide what
                        runs and what doesn't. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Sounds great doesn't it? Yeah that depends. It can 
                        either go amazingly well or it can be painfully
                        horrible. From my experience, read + experiment.
                        Questions like "hey what does this do?" and "what
                        happens if I delete this?" along with reading up
                        posts in forums from other users will teach you a LOT.
                        Trust me, I know (learned it the hard way lmao). 
                        The more the reason to be hyped about it. However, 
                        Arch isn't the only thing we need for a complete
                        environment.

                    <h2>What is Hyprland?</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Aite I'll be honest, I had to read up on some of
                        this stuff so bear with me here ;-;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before I talk about Hyprland, I need to explain what
                        we're dealing with here. So Arch is the OS but when you
                        install it, the installation process will prompt you 
                        for a "desktop environment" (yeah i know my stuff 
                        alright) in order to have a complete setup because
                        Arch won't have one by default. A 
                        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_environment" target="_blank">desktop environment</a> 
                        (DE) is the visual layer that provides things like 
                        windows, panels, menus, wallpapers, and basic system 
                        tools so you could use a mouse and a keyboard. Without 
                        it, you are literally going to use Arch with just a 
                        terminal. It looks pretty sick actually but you can't 
                        do much in terms of ricing it without a DE. But then 
                        you might be thinking, "If DEs give us
                        basic tools, then Arch DOES work right out of the box,
                        right?" Not...quite...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's the weird bit, Hyprland isn't technically a DE.
                        We have this other thing called a 
                        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Window_manager" target=_blank>window manager</a> 
                        (WM). Instead of introducing menus, wallpapers, and basic 
                        system tools, WMs only control how windows open, move, and
                        are arranged on the screen. They do not include stuff like
                        a taskbar, settings app or even a file manager. It 
                        simply tells Arch, "hey I'll determine and control how 
                        you should order the window panels on screen". This is
                        great because just like how we want our system to be empty 
                        (like my life) upon installation, a WM is perfect for this. 
                        But wait...so Hyprland is a WM? well...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://hypr.land/" target=_blank>Hyprland</a> 
                        is a dynamic tiling Wayland 
                        compositor. Yeah. I wish I'm joking. Basically,
                        it is a bit different compared to its WM cousins (like i3
                        and Sway). Hyprland is more modern and highly customizable.
                        This makes it look wayyyy better especially with
                        some of those satisfying animations. I haven't tried
                        the other ones but I honestly think that Hyprland
                        is one of the best combos out there for Arch. 
                        Match made in heaven.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        So now you know what Arch and Hyprland is, but how do we 
                        download stuff? Let me introduce you to Arch's package
                        manager, pacman (get it? PACkage MANager? ahah). A 
                        <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/linux-package-management-overview/" target=_blank>package manager</a> 
                        is the tool used to install, update, 
                        and remove software on the system and 
                        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman" target=_blank>pacman</a> 
                        is Arch's package manager. This is how you get 
                        programs on and off your system. Instead of downloading
                        them from websites (since you won't even have a browser
                        to begin with), you download them straight from your
                        terminal! (once you've figured out how to connect to the 
                        internet via terminal lol). Pacman is also the tool you
                        use to update your system. It was a weird concept to me
                        when I started using Arch BUT with time, you just get used 
                        to it. If you are looking for a way to get the hang of using 
                        the command line and terminal, use Arch. As a guy who needs
                        to learn and use the Linux Command Line, being on Arch helps
                        since all you'll do is interacting with the terminal. If you 
                        hate it, man I've got news for you hahahahhaha

                    <p>
                        Arch isn't complete without some downloads. Aside from
                        the standard programs (like VSCode, Telegram), here are 
                        some of my favourites that make my setup feel like home:

                        <ul>
                            <li>neofetch (i dont remember if this was pre-installed or not but eh)</li>
                            <li>waybar</li>
                            <li>yazi file manager</li>
                            <li>rofi launcher</li>
                            <li>lvsk-calendar</li>
                            <li>btop task manager</li>
                            <li>yt-x (yt on terminal)</li>
                            <li>rmpc media player</li>
                            <li>lazyvim (neovim fork)</li>
                            <li>cava audio visualizer</li>
                            <li>mapscii (a literal ascii map projection)</li>
                            <li>cmatrix animation</li>
                            <li>pipes animation</li>
                            <li>rotating cube animation</li>
                        </ul>

                        There is a ton more but these are just a few that I would
                        like to highlight. They look incredible. I really think
                        that there are more that I haven't discovered. You usually 
                        find them in some guy's repo (a total genius) on github.
                        Let me tell you, some of them are cooking some amazing 
                        stuff.

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        I'll be honest, I don't think this will be a simple little
                        project post if I get into the tidbits of things. I made
                        a <a href="https://github.com/rizqkhairulnizam/arch-hypr-dotfiles" target="_blank">github repo</a> 
                        that contains my dotfiles and my rofi dmenu
                        stuff (along with screenshots and some cool wallpapers) 
                        if you want to dive deeper. This isn't meant
                        to be a tutorial (oh god no) on how to get 
                        things started because if I must be honest with you
                        here, I don't even wanna go through the installation
                        process again...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started doing this around early-2025 and I have come 
                        far enough to kinda know what I'm doing and dumb enough
                        to make stupid mistakes. I could literally make changes
                        that would make certain stuff stop working. Like an idiot. 
                        Here's the thing. Don't be afraid to make changes to
                        those config files. Crawl through your directories, 
                        see what's in them. It's fine if you
                        don't wanna change them, read through
                        them. What do they do? what do they mean? I'll tell you
                        this right now, you will not stop learning, but that is also
                        the fun part. But you will still, at some point, feel like you
                        got a good view of what and how things are.
                        Once you get comfortable with the terminal and the system, 
                        change it a bit and maybe even write your
                        own thing. I wrote my own settings menu via rofi's dmenu.
                        The possibilities are endless. Go crazy.
                    </p>

                        Happy tinkering.
